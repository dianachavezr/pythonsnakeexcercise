### Snake Game

This excercise has been done in order to learn the basics of Python.

During the development of the game we learned how to create classes, variables, construtors and methods.

We also exported Turtle and Random libraries to create the game, and we learned also about POO and how we can use it to create a better, simple and organized code.
